Welcome to you all !

This [GitHub Home page](https://github.com/Jandsy/ml_finance_imperial) contains all the materials for the course **Machine Learning and Finance 2024** at Imperial College London.

## Instructors
* Arnaud de Servigny
* Jeremy Chichportich

## Getting Started

* The scripts are written as Jupyter notebooks and run directly in Google Colab.
* For those who'd like to execute the scripts locally, consider using Jupyter Notebook. Check out this [tutorial](https://test-jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) on how to install Jupyter through Anaconda for detailed guidance.

## Introduction to Python
* For students who are beginners in Python, we highly recommend following this [Introduction to Python](Additional_Materials/Programming_Session_0.ipynb). Feel free to ask questions about it.

## Module Outline Information

### Module Description
The course consists of nine sessions, each lasting three hours, and includes both lectures and hands-on practice. Students should plan to spend a similar amount of time studying the course materials both individually and in groups outside of class. Python will be used in various aspects of the instructional approach.


### Learning Outcomes 


The goals of this course include:

* Gaining insight into the process of creating machine learning systems.
* Acquiring familiarity with both classic Machine Learning algorithms and cutting-edge methods, such as Deep Learning.
* Understanding the foundational principles of Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, and Sequence Models.
* Enhancing abilities to handle sequential data, particularly for applications in Natural Language Processing.
* Applying supervised learning techniques to predict the risk of loan default.
* Conducting sentiment analysis using advanced algorithms designed for sequential data.


## Assessment 

* Coursework: 50%
* Exam : 50%
